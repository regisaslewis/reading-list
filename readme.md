## Regis's Book List

The main goal of this site is to quickly display a list of books that I have either finished reading or that I'm currently working my way through.  This will help me keep organized a running tally of all I've read, neatly arranged and cleanly presented.

A row of "tiles" at the bottom of the page shows a thumbnail of the each of book's cover image.  When a mouse hovers over the thumbnail, the title appears plainly.  When a tile is clicked, it opens a larger version of the cover image, as well as details about the selected book.

Title, author, genre, and whether or not I've completed reading are listed within the details.

If the book has been read, a rating is given, as well as my brief assessment of the book.

For the books that I have yet to finish, a couple input fields are provided for me to rate the book and provide my assesment.

In the upper-right corner, there is a button for adding a new book, either one that I've already finished reading, or one that I'm working on, with plans to finish soon.

Here it is in action:
